1. "index.html": This is the main HTML file that will contain the structure of the website. It will include references to the other CSS files ("styles.css" and "tailwind.css"). It will contain DOM elements with unique id names that can be used for styling and scripting.

2. "styles.css": This is the custom CSS file for the website. It will contain styles that are not covered by Tailwind CSS. It will use the id names of the DOM elements defined in "index.html".

3. "tailwind.css": This is the Tailwind CSS file. It's a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs. It will also use the id names of the DOM elements defined in "index.html".

Shared Dependencies:

1. DOM Element IDs: These are unique identifiers for elements in the "index.html" file. Both "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" will use these IDs to apply styles to the corresponding elements.

2. CSS Classes: These are shared between "index.html" and the CSS files. The HTML file will use class names to apply styles, and the CSS files will define what those styles are.

3. External Libraries: Tailwind CSS is an external library that will be used in this project. It will be included in the "index.html" file and used in the "tailwind.css" file.

4. Media Queries: These are used in CSS files to make the website responsive. They are shared between "styles.css" and "tailwind.css".

5. Color Schemes: The dark, clean, and simple color scheme will be shared across all files. The specific colors used will be defined in the CSS files and applied to elements in the "index.html" file.

6. Font Styles: The font styles will be shared across all files. The specific fonts used will be defined in the CSS files and applied to elements in the "index.html" file.
